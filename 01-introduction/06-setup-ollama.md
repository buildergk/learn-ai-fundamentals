## Setup Ollama
- Navigate to https://ollama.com
- Download the ollama executable
- Install ollama
- Launch a terminal window
- Run the command `ollama run gpt-oss` to pull and run the gpt-oss model. Replace <gpt-oss> with the model of your choice. To find the list of available models visit: https://ollama.com/models.


Note: For practice, Ollama should be enough. If you need a more efficient model for production, consider using [OpenAI](./06-Setup-OpenAI.md).
