## Setup Project

### Setup Project Folder
- Create a folder name that you would like. Example: `learn-ai-fundamentals`.
- Open the directory in the IDE of your choice. Cursor or VS Code preferred.


### Setup Environment File
- Create a `.env` file at the root of the directory. This file holds the secrets and variables related to the project environment.


### Setup GitIgnore

- Add the environment file in the `.gitignore` file. The contents of the file should look like below.
  ```
  .env
  ```
